# ‚öñÔ∏è BMI Calculator ‚Äì Python Project

This Python project calculates a user's **Body Mass Index (BMI)** using the height and weight provided by the user. It then classifies the BMI into categories such as **underweight**, **normal**, **overweight**, and various **obesity levels**, along with the associated health risks.

---

## üí° What It Does

- Takes user input for height (in metres or centimetres) and weight (in kilograms)
- Automatically converts height from cm to m if needed
- Validates inputs to ensure positive values
- Displays:
  - Calculated BMI value
  - BMI classification (e.g., Normal, Overweight, Obesity Class I, etc.)
  - Associated health risk

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system (Python 3.6+ recommended).  
2. Save the code in a `.py` file (e.g., `bmi_calculator.py`).  
3. Run the program in your terminal or any Python IDE.
