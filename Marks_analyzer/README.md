# 🎓 Student Marks Analyzer – Python Project

This Python project allows users to input **marks of students** and then perform different operations such as calculating **average, highest, lowest, and count of passing students**.  
It demonstrates concepts of **lists, loops, conditionals, and mathematical operations** in Python.

## 💡 What It Does

- Accepts a list of student marks (out of 500) entered by the user  
- Allows the user to choose a task:
  - **Average** → Calculates the average marks of all students  
  - **Highest** → Finds the highest marks scored  
  - **Lowest** → Finds the lowest marks scored  
  - **Count** → Counts the number of students who passed (marks ≥ 175)  
- Handles multiple roll numbers at once
