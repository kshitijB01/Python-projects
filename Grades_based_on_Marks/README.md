# 📝 Subject-wise Grade Calculator – Python Project

This Python program allows users to input marks for **Physics**, **Chemistry**, and **Mathematics**, and then calculates both:

- **Subject-wise grades**
- **Overall grade** based on the total score out of 300

---

## 💡 What It Does

- Takes input marks (out of 100) for:
  - Physics
  - Chemistry
  - Mathematics
- Assigns grades for each subject:
  - A (91–100)
  - B (81–90)
  - C (71–80)
  - D (Below 71)
- Calculates total marks and gives an overall grade:
  - A (291–300)
  - B (281–290)
  - C (271–280)
  - D (Below 271)

## 🎓 Grading System Used

### Subject-wise Grades:
| Marks Range | Grade |
|-------------|--------|
| 91 – 100    | A      |
| 81 – 90     | B      |
| 71 – 80     | C      |
| Below 71    | D      |

### Grand Total Grades:
| Total Marks | Grade |
|-------------|--------|
| 291 – 300   | A      |
| 281 – 290   | B      |
| 271 – 280   | C      |
| Below 271   | D      |

## ⚠️ Note

- The program assumes valid numeric input.
- You can extend this by:
  - Adding validation to ensure inputs are between 0 and 100
  - Accepting more subjects
  - Adding percentage calculation
